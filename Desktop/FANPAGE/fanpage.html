	<h2><strong>Biography</h2></strong>

	<p class="purple"><strong>
		Elle Varner is of African American, White American and Cape Verdean descent and the daughter of Mikelyn Roderick and Jimmy Varner, songwriters and publishers.  Varner's mother, Roderick was a backup vocalist for Barry White and has written and recorded with Tevin Campbell and Rahsaan Patterson. Roderick released an album on the Dome label in 2007.  Her father, Jimmy Varner is a songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist who has collaborated with Gerald Alston, Kool and the Gang, and Will Downing.

	<p class="hotpink"><strong>
		At just the age of six Varner learned how to play the flute and later moved on to play the piano and the guitar.  She attended several music programs including actress Wendy Raquel Robinson's Amazing Grace Conservatory starting at age 11 and Alexander Hamilton High School's Academy of Music's Vocal Jazz Group.  While there, she created her first song, “Thankful”.  The song was phenomenal and scored the top prize at a local talent show.  Varner played the song with <em><strong> only one string</strong></em> on the guitar.  This helped her to earn a spot in New York University’s Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music (which only accepts 24 students per year) and was further proof that she was headed in the right direction. In 2008 Varner graduated from NYU's renowned Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music.
